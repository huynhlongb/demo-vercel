        an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
        of<i> Nature, New Scientist </i>and all the orther scientific journals her work had
        appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road. </cite>It had been Molly's favorite book
        since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
